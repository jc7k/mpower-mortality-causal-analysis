# MPOWER Mechanism Analysis: Research Extension

## Overview

This research extension implements component-specific causal analysis to identify which individual MPOWER policies drive mortality effects.

## Methodology

### Component Decomposition
- **M (Monitor)**: Monitor tobacco use and prevention policies (threshold ≥4)
- **P (Protect)**: Protect from tobacco smoke (threshold ≥4)
- **O (Offer)**: Offer help to quit tobacco use (threshold ≥4)
- **W (Warn)**: Warn about the dangers of tobacco (threshold ≥3)
- **E (Enforce)**: Enforce bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship (threshold ≥4)
- **R (Raise)**: Raise taxes on tobacco (threshold ≥4)

### Causal Inference Approach
- **Treatment Definition**: Binary indicators for high implementation (component score ≥ threshold)
- **Methods**: Callaway & Sant'Anna DiD, Synthetic Control Methods
- **Identification**: Component-specific staggered adoption timing
- **Controls**: GDP per capita, urbanization, education expenditure

## Research Value

### Policy Prioritization
- Identifies which MPOWER components have strongest mortality effects
- Provides evidence-based ranking for resource allocation
- Supports targeted implementation strategies

### Implementation Insights
- Component-specific treatment effects enable cost-effectiveness comparison
- Sequential implementation guidance based on effectiveness rankings
- Cross-component interaction analysis potential

## Technical Achievement

- ✅ **Component Detection**: Automatic identification of MPOWER score columns
- ✅ **Treatment Creation**: Evidence-based binary treatment indicators
- ✅ **Multi-Method Support**: R/Python/fallback implementation backends
- ✅ **Result Aggregation**: Component ranking and comparison framework
- ✅ **Policy Integration**: Ready for real-world application
