# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.1] - 2025-08-27

### Fixed
- Correct p-value calculations in Callaway & Sant'Anna aggregation (use normal CDF across simple/group/calendar/event).
- Pass properly indexed data to `linearmodels` predict in panel methods to avoid misalignment.

### Improved
- Standardized logging across core modules (analysis, synthetic_control, mechanism_analysis); removed prints.
- Ensure plot directories exist before saving figures (descriptives and analysis paths).
- Vectorized group-wise forward/backward fill in data preparation for better performance.
- Harden JSON export for results and avoid unsafe `isinstance` unions.

### Cleanups
- Replaced bare `except:` with `except Exception` in core utilities and spillover pipeline.
- Removed unused imports/variables; clarified ambiguous names in spillover utilities.

### CI
- Scoped ruff lint/format to `src/**` to avoid noise from examples/scripts.

### Docs
- Added AGENTS.md contributor guidelines.
- Added CODE_REVIEW.md with identified issues and suggested patches.

## [2.0.0] - 2025-01-18

## Migration Guide

### Upgrading from v1.x to v2.0

The new extensions are fully backward compatible. To use the new features:

```python
# Import new extension modules
from mpower_mortality_causal_analysis.extensions.advanced_did import SunAbraham
from mpower_mortality_causal_analysis.extensions.cost_effectiveness import HealthEconomicModel
from mpower_mortality_causal_analysis.extensions.spillover import SpatialAnalysis
from mpower_mortality_causal_analysis.extensions.optimization import PolicyOptimizer

# Or use through the main pipeline
pipeline = MPOWERAnalysisPipeline(data_path)
results = pipeline.run_full_analysis(
    include_extensions=['advanced_did', 'cost_effectiveness', 'spillover', 'optimization']
)
```

### Breaking Changes
None - all v1.x code remains fully functional.

### Deprecations
None - no features have been deprecated.
