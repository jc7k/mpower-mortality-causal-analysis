## Key Components

### 1. Health Outcomes Model (`health_outcomes.py`)
- **QALYs Calculation**: Age-stratified quality-adjusted life years with utility weights
- **DALYs Calculation**: Disability-adjusted life years using GBD disability weights
- **Markov Modeling**: Disease progression simulation with 4 health states
- **Discounting**: Exponential discounting for future health benefits (default 3%)
- **Key Methods**:
  - `calculate_qalys()`: Returns total and discounted QALYs by age group
  - `calculate_dalys()`: Computes YLL and YLD averted
  - `markov_model()`: Simulates disease progression over time

### 2. Cost Estimator (`cost_models.py`)
- **Implementation Costs**: WHO-CHOICE based per-capita costs by income group
- **Healthcare Savings**: Disease-specific treatment cost offsets
- **Productivity Gains**: Age-adjusted economic value of prevented deaths
- **Net Cost Analysis**: Break-even and ROI calculations
- **Key Features**:
  - Income-stratified cost estimates (low/middle/high income)
  - Front-loaded implementation cost distribution
  - Sigmoid accumulation of healthcare savings
  - Age-specific productivity multipliers

### 3. ICER Analysis (`icer_analysis.py`)
- **ICER Calculation**: Incremental cost per QALY/DALY gained
- **Dominance Analysis**: Identifies dominated and dominant strategies
- **Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis**: Monte Carlo simulation with parameter uncertainty
- **CEAC Generation**: Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves
- **Advanced Features**:
  - Efficient frontier identification
  - Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI)
  - Tornado diagram generation for one-way sensitivity

### 4. Budget Optimizer (`budget_optimizer.py`)
- **Linear Programming**: Optimal allocation with binary constraints
- **Nonlinear Optimization**: Continuous allocation with diminishing returns
- **Portfolio Theory**: Risk-adjusted optimization using covariance
- **Incremental Analysis**: Step-wise budget allocation
- **Key Capabilities**:
  - Multi-constraint optimization (budget, capacity, dependencies)
  - Sensitivity to budget changes
  - Pareto frontier identification

### 5. CE Pipeline (`ce_pipeline.py`)
- **Complete Workflow**: Orchestrates all components end-to-end
- **Data Integration**: Loads causal analysis results and economic data
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Health outcomes, costs, ICERs, and optimization
- **Export Functionality**: Multiple output formats (JSON, Excel, CSV)
- **Key Methods**:
  - `run_analysis()`: Complete cost-effectiveness evaluation
  - `export_results()`: Multi-format result export
  - `generate_report()`: Automated report generation

### 6. CE Reporting (`ce_reporting.py`)
- **Report Formats**: Summary, detailed, and comprehensive reports
- **Visualizations**: Cost-effectiveness planes, CEAC curves, tornado diagrams
- **Tables**: ICER league tables, budget impact analysis
- **Export Options**: Markdown, HTML, Excel formats

## Implementation Decisions

### 1. Data Type Handling
- Fixed critical bug in `ce_pipeline.py` where mortality reduction data wasn't properly converted to float
- Ensured robust type conversion throughout the pipeline
- Added fallback values for missing data

### 2. Statistical Robustness
- Added `abs()` wrapper in PSA to ensure positive standard deviations
- Implemented proper normalization in Markov transition matrices
- Added bounds checking for probability values

### 3. Default Values
- WHO-CHOICE based implementation costs
- GBD disability weights for standard diseases
- 3% discount rate following health economics guidelines
- $50,000 WTP threshold (adjustable)

### 4. Computational Efficiency
- Vectorized operations using NumPy where possible
- Caching of intermediate results in pipeline
- Lazy evaluation of expensive computations

## Testing Coverage

### Test Suite Statistics
- **Total Tests**: 18 test methods
- **Coverage**: 84% on cost-effectiveness modules
- **Test Categories**:
  - Unit tests for each component
  - Integration tests for complete workflow
  - Edge case handling
  - Sensitivity analysis validation

### Key Test Cases
1. **Health Outcomes**: QALY/DALY calculations, Markov convergence
2. **Cost Models**: Implementation costs, healthcare savings, net costs
3. **ICER Analysis**: Basic ICER, dominance detection, PSA convergence
4. **Budget Optimization**: Linear/nonlinear optimization, portfolio theory
5. **Pipeline Integration**: Full workflow with real data structure

## Usage Example

```python
from mpower_mortality_causal_analysis.extensions.cost_effectiveness import CEPipeline

# Initialize pipeline with mortality data
pipeline = CEPipeline(
    mortality_data=mortality_df,
    cost_data=economic_df,
    wtp_threshold=30000
)

# Run complete analysis
results = pipeline.run_analysis(
    country="Brazil",
    policies=["M", "P", "O", "W", "E", "R"],
    budget=5000000,
    sensitivity=True
)

# Export results
pipeline.export_results("results/", formats=["json", "excel"])
pipeline.generate_report("report.md", format="comprehensive")
```
