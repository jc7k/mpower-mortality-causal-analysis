# Project Purpose & Overview

## Primary Purpose
This is a **Context Engineering Template** project that has been adapted for a specific **MPOWER Tobacco Control Policy Causal Analysis** research study. The project serves dual purposes:

1. **Template Demonstration**: Shows how to use Context Engineering principles for AI-assisted development
2. **Research Implementation**: Conducts rigorous causal inference analysis of WHO MPOWER tobacco control policies' impact on mortality outcomes (2008-2019)

## Research Objectives
The core research analyzes the causal impact of WHO's MPOWER tobacco control measures on:
- Adult tobacco use prevalence
- Lung cancer mortality rates
- Cardiovascular disease mortality rates

## Methodological Innovation
- First empirical study linking MPOWER policies to actual mortality outcomes (vs. simulation)
- First application of Callaway & Sant'Anna (2021) staggered difference-in-differences to tobacco policy evaluation
- Demonstrates modern causal inference methods in Python ecosystem

## Key Stakeholders
- **Policymakers & Public Health Officials**: Evidence on which tobacco control policies save lives most effectively
- **Researchers & Academics**: Cutting-edge causal inference methods for policy evaluation
- **Citizens & Advocates**: Empirical evidence on government actions that reduce tobacco deaths

## Context Engineering Framework
The project uses Product Requirements Prompts (PRPs) to provide comprehensive context for AI coding assistants, including:
- Complete documentation and examples
- Implementation steps with validation
- Error handling patterns
- Test requirements
